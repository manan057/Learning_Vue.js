new Vue ==> new view instance. core of each core of view application that vue is used in.
Controls their own template of html code.
You can access all the properities and maplets using this

el: '#id'
v-on: listen to event

curly braces only works on text not html elements like img, a href, etc
instead of h-ref="{{link}}"; use v-bind:href="link"

Vue.js automatically fetches arguments

* Synchronous *
Everything you use from computed method can be used as properties
Things in computed doesn't get executed everytime
-- computed caches the result
Use computed when you can

* Asynschronous *
To react to every change or to use async tasks
watch only happens after a specific trigger
eg. api call

call back closures can't access propertities so you have to store them in varibales
right before the functions
eg. var vm = this;
    setTimeout(function() {
      //closure
      vm.counter = 0;
    }, 2000);


#Shortcuts
v-on:click ==> @click
v-bind:href ==> :href
